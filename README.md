# segmentTest
This repository is built for doing segment test on marketing surveys.
Setments are represented by ordinal variables. For example, Stronly disagree - Strongly agree: 1 - 7

For each question in the survey, the program will produce a csv file as output. The output demonstrate the mean scores(1-7) of all questions answered by respondnets that in segments.
For example, a segment is people who answered strongly agree in the question 'Are you missing food from your hometown?'. Then we will calculte the rating scores on other questions of this segment.
